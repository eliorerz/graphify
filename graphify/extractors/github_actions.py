"""GitHub Actions workflow extractor.

Scoped to GitHub Actions workflow YAML only (job nodes, ``needs``/``uses``
edges). Adapted from the tree-sitter-yaml traversal helpers and
workflow-shape extraction logic in Graphify-Labs/graphify PR #2541
(unmerged as of this writing), with attribution rather than a blind copy.
That PR also models Docker Compose services under the same extractor; the
Compose branch is deliberately not ported here -- this fork's need is
GitHub Actions specifically, and folding in a second, unrelated shape would
widen the surface this file has to stay correct for with no requirement to
justify it, plus that PR keeps YAML entirely in DOC_EXTENSIONS (registering
an extractor alone doesn't touch classification), so it never actually
solves running under ``graphify extract --code-only`` -- the reason this
file exists is to combine the extractor with a ``detect.classify_file``
carve-out (see ``is_github_actions_workflow_path`` below and its use in
``graphify/detect.py``) that makes recognized workflow YAML a code-equivalent
input, not just add a semantic-pass extractor.
