"""Tests for the GitHub Actions extractor (graphify/extractors/github_actions.py)
and its detect.classify_file() carve-out.

Scoped to GitHub Actions workflow YAML only -- no Docker Compose (out of this
fork's scope; see the module docstring in github_actions.py). Two concerns
are tested together since they are two halves of the same feature:
1. extract_github_actions() itself (job/needs/uses extraction).
2. classify_file() routing recognized workflow paths to FileType.CODE, which
   is what makes them usable under `graphify extract --code-only` -- the
   actual point of this feature, not just adding a semantic-pass extractor.
